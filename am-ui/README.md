The actual components of a page are located in the webcomponents/ directory and will be build and copied to the scripts folder for the frontend to use.

Run `npm run start` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Running unit tests

Run `npm run test` to execute the unit tests via [Jest](https://jestjs.io).

## Lint

Run `npm run test` to lint the project via [Angular-Eslint](https://github.com/angular-eslint/angular-eslint), [GTS](https://github.com/google/gts) and [Stylelint](https://stylelint.io).
