# Status:
- **To specify** 
- **In specification**
- **Ready for Refinement**
- **Ready for DEV** 
- **In progress**
- **Passed/Rejected**

# General Workflow
- PO/BA creates Story (Status **To specify**)
- When starting to specify status should be changed to **In specification**: 
	- Talks to Dev and Designer if needed **before** refinement
	- Can schedule meetings if needed
- When PO/BA thinks specification is complete -> Status changes to **Ready for Refinement**
	- DoR should to be fulfilled
- If team accepts the story in the refinement -> Status changes to **Ready for Dev**
- In the planning, the team reviews all the tickets with the status *Ready for Dev* and move them to the Kanban-board. From then on out it has the status **In Progress**
- Once it has passed through the cycle, depending on the outcome it either gets the status **Passed** or **Rejected**.
	

# DoR
- *External* dependencies are identified or eliminated
- If needed, a design (at least LoFi?) exists
- Has meaningful acceptance criteria
- The story is understood and accepted by the team

## Meetings
- Refinement

Generally the refinement is there to make sure the backlog items are relevant, detailed, prioritized and estimated so that they are ready to get moved to the Kanban board. It will take a look at all the tickets that are in the status **Ready for refinement**. The specification itself should take place *before* the refinement with the relevant parties - The refinement itself will present the results from that specification to the team to make sure it is understood and accepted.

- Planning:	
	- Cleanup
	- Taking tickets that are *Ready for Dev* into Kanban (Status changes to **In progress**, Tasking
