AKROS Marketplace, short AMP, is an application for companies internal advertising and is used for search and advertise an appartement, a room a roommate. The application is expandable and can include additional categories e.g. to search and advertise ride- or clothes-sharing, rent a car, et cetera.

The project is hosted on Github public. It is licensed under the Apache License. Public means that the code is an AKROS business card. Quality and state of the art development is essential.

The application should serve

- to train and practice the AKROS employee for current and future development processes, technologies and "best practices",
- to assess the candidates in the hiring process.

## Running the application

The easiest way to run the application is to start the docker-compose for the entire application. This requires a docker installation.
To do so, run the command below **inside** the  `./infrastructure/start_local` folder. The frontend will be running on the following link: https://localhost:4200 and the backend on https://localhost:8443

   ```
    docker-compose --profile local up -d --build
   ```
   
For more information and for local development setup, check the `README` file in the folder `./infrastructure/start_local`.
